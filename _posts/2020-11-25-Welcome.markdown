# [Chapter 5, Microservices architecture](https://github.com/neilabenlakhal/neilabenlakhal.github.io/tree/master/2020-2021Lecture/SOC/Chapter_5) 

 `Chapter 5 Microservice Architecture (MSA) : key architectural elements`. The objective of this chapter is to introduce the essentials of MSA as an architecture that breaks down an application into microservices, each of which can be independently, as well as frequently, deployed and thus facilitate continuous delivery of the application to customers. By the end of the chapter, students will understand the need for MSA, how MSA meets the modern business requirements, and typical use cases, benefits, drawbacks, how MSA differs from SOA. Furthermore, students will learn key architectural elements involved in developing an MSA-based application: the communication models of MSA, microservice discovery and the role of the API gate way in discover. He will understand how services interact with one another synchronously and asynchronously using standard architectures, protocols, and message brokers and how clients discover and access different services using service discovery mechanisms and the API gateway.
