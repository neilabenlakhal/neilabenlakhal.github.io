📝 **ToDo**
The objective of this section, is to explore frameworks and tools required to build a RESTFUL Web services. Design guidelines that developers will find useful while building RESTful web services are also given.
#### Running lecture demos:

In order to implement RESTful Web services, you will need: 

   - A service container : to deploy and publish the service.  
   - An HTTP library  : to handle service HTTP-based invocations.
   - JSON formatting tools : to encode and decode service data to be sent/received in the body of an HTTP request/response.
   - XML library : To parse XML, serialize and deserialize service data to be sent/received in the body of an HTTP request/response.
   - APIs frameworks to implement and handle restful services requests and responses.


 Web services examples of this course are deployed in Apache, and are written in Php.<br>

To run demo Web services provided with this lecture, you need first to clone the following repository on your machine: [https://github.com/neilabenlakhal/REST.git](https://github.com/neilabenlakhal/REST.git).  

 Then, you need the following tools installed :  

* [AMPPS](https://ampps.com/downloads) is a MAMP, WAMP and LAMP software stack from Softaculous enabling Apache, Mysql, MongoDB, PHP, Perl, and Python. This includes everything you need for website development. Start developing your website from open source web applications or just start writing code yourself. 
  
* [PHP’s cURL extension](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php) : PhP has its own wrappers for cURL. [cURL](https://curl.se/) allows to make any web request imaginable in any form, repeat those requests, and observe in detail exactly what information is exchanged between client and server. It is a brilliant, quick tool for inspecting what’s going on with a Web request, particularly when dealing with something that isn’t in a browser or where you need to be more specific about how the request is made. PhP's cURL extension  has excellent and comprehensive documentation on [http://php.net](http://php.net). We can use this extension to make all kinds of HTTP requests, including sending custom headers, sending body data, and using different verbs to make our request. The PHP cURL extension isn’t the easiest interface to use, although it does have the advantage of being reliably available. 

* [PHP’s built-in stream-handling functionality] :  Another great way of making HTTP requests that is always available in PHP is to use PHP’s stream-handling abilities with the file functions. In its simplest form, this means that, if `allow_url_fopen` is enabled (see the PHP manual), it is possible to make requests using `file_get_contents()`. The simplest example is making a `GET` request and reading the response body in as if it were a local file. Using the PHP `file_get_contents()` function, we can read files or API data but can not perform write, update, delete operations. Use cURL methods to perform all those operations using API data.
  
 * These chrome extensions with added-value :  
     * JSON formatter : beautifies JSON data with advanced formatting and validation algorithms. 
     * Network Sniffer : network traffic analyser to capture HTTP requests/responses.
  
* [POSTMAN](https://www.postman.com/) : is an API client that makes it easy for developers to create, share, test and document APIs. This is done by allowing users to create and save simple and complex HTTP/s requests, as well as read their responses. It is a great tool when trying to dissect RESTful APIs made by others or test ones you have made yourself. It offers a user interface with which to make HTML requests to test an API's functionality. 

To see the actual HTTP request traffic that is being sent and received in the application. In some cases, you might discover APIs that are not even documented. Postman Console allows to see and capture this network traffic easily. 
  
* [SOAPUI the open source version](https://www.soapui.org/downloads/soapui/):  an API (SOAP/REST) testing tool.

#### Testing others Web services implementation platforms  :  
 

Every programming language has one or several APIs  to implement Web services that support SOAP based communication. for this `ToDo3_2` section, you are highly advised to do the following Lab exercises, to get familiarized with implementing Web services in Java and .NET.

* __Implementing web services in JAVA__: Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS) is a technology for building web services and clients that communicate using XML. There are currently many platforms that implement it, Apache CXF and Apache Axis 2 are two implementations of JAX-WS.

   -[Apache Axis2](http://axis.apache.org/axis2/java/core/) project:  is a Java-based implementation of both the client and server sides of the Web services equation. Apache Axis2 provides a complete object model and a modular architecture that makes it easy to add functionality and support for new Web services-related specifications and recommendations. Axis2 enables you to easily perform the following tasks:
    - Send SOAP messages.
    - Receive and process SOAP messages.
    - Create a Web service out of a plain Java class.
    - Create implementation classes for both the server and client using WSDL.
    - Easily retrieve the WSDL for a service. <br><br>
  
   -[Apache CXF](https://cxf.apache.org/): is an open source services framework. CXF helps you build and develop services using frontend programming APIs, like JAX-WS (SOAP) and JAX-RS (REST). These services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP, XML/HTTP, RESTful HTTP, or CORBA and work over a variety of transports such as HTTP, JMS or JBI.


* __Implementing web services with Windows Communication Foundation (WCF):__ WCF is a framework for building service-oriented (SOAP/REST) applications. Using WCF, you can send data as asynchronous messages from one service endpoint to another. A service endpoint can be part of a continuously available service hosted by IIS, or it can be a service hosted in an application. An endpoint can be a client of a service that requests data from a service endpoint. The messages can be as simple as a single character or word sent as XML, or as complex as a stream of binary data. 

* __Practical Exercises :__

  - Lab Exercise 00 : Creating a WSDL File. Many tools can be used to create a WSDL file. We can generate it using NUSOAP, [PhP2WSDL](https://www.phpclasses.org/package/3509-PHP-Generate-WSDL-from-PHP-classes-code.html) or WSDL2JAVA, or we can use tools like Eclipse. This is a tutorial about [creating WSDL in Eclipse](https://help.eclipse.org/2020-09/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.wst.wsdl.ui.doc.user%2Ftasks%2Ftcrtwsdl.html). You can also use this [tutorial](https://crunchify.com/create-sample-wsdl-in-eclipse-and-generate-client/) as additional explanation.

* __Web service testing :__

In order to test web services we will be using :

* [SOAPUI the open source version](https://www.soapui.org/downloads/soapui/),  an API (SOAP/REST) testing tool.
  
### After lecture : 

💻 **ToCode** 

The objective of this `ToCode3_2` section is to create a Web services composition `(WSC)` composed of two(2) Web services : `WS1` and `WS2`. <br>

  - `WS1`: is a Web service you have to implement yourself.
  - `WS2`: is a Web service you have to choose from internet, then, write a client against `WS2`.
  - `WS1` and `WS2` are to be invoked sequentially by a Web interface transparently.

Sample scenarios you can consider :

  - `WS1`  makes a fictive travel reservation for a customer. The total amount will be returned in TND. `WS2` will provide a reservation confirmation with the total amount in  another currency, for instance USD.  

  - `WS1` lets a user choose a preferred vacation destination, and `WS2`, will provide the user with the weather forecast, for the designated destination and date.

> Step 1

Implement a SOAP web service (bottom-up approach)-- we will call it `WS1`.<br>
   -  Write a  PHP web service using NUSOAP library. Your web service should have at least (2)two methods. one of them having a table as input/output. Your generated WSDL file should define at least one complex data type.
   - Write a client in PHP to your Web service (one of the (2)two methods).  

Implement a SOAP web service (Top-down approach) -- we will call it `WS-TD`.
    - Write another PhP web services. Your web service should have one method.  
    - Write a client in PHP to your Web service.  
    - Generate your Web service contract using php2WSDL.  
    - Create another client for your web service in another programming language of your choice.  

> Step 2

Search for your `WS2` : it should supports SOAP-based invocation. Test the web service and write a client.

> Step 3  

Write a client for `WS1` and `WS2`. 
Hint: The output of `WS1` must be an input to `WS2`.

> Step 4

Call `WS1` and `WS2` composition using a Web interface.

> What to submit ?

-Create a folder and name it `ToCode3_2`. Create four(4) subfolders named : `WS1`, `WS2`, `WS-TD`, and `WSC`. 
- Store the source code, of the WS and the client of each WS. Add  SOAPUI tests of you `WS1`, `WS2`, and `WS-TD` (print screens). 
- Store the source code of the composition in `WSC` with print screen of its execution interface with results. You may add an explanatory description of your composition with each web service methods, input and output parameters.

- Push your  `ToCode3_2` to your `GIT` repository.  
- Send the following on Microsoft Teams : Link of your git repository.
