# Chapter 1 : [Demystifying Software Architecture](https://github.com/neilabenlakhal/neilabenlakhal.github.io/tree/master/2020-2021Lecture/SOC/Chapter_1)

## Chapter synopsis
*This chapter begins the course by providing a definition of software architecture and lists and details a number of software architecture styles classifications. We will also present different object-oriented distributed computing technologies, such as CORBA, DCOM, and RMI and list their limitations that led to service architectural styles emergence. Several examples of each type of architectural style will be also provided.*

üìù **ToDo**

* Objective : Get familiarised with GiT.
* First you need to create [GitHub.com account](http://github.com) : You can use the command line, and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (the version control software GitHub is built on) or download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or work from Github Web interface.
- You need to Learn:  how to create, clone a repository, push, pull add commit modifications to a remote repository, etc.

- You can use theses resources : 

  * üîó Quick reference guides: [GitHub Cheat Sheet](https://training.github.com/), [Visual Git Cheat Sheet](https://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html).
  * üîó [Git Book v2](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).

## After lecture : 

üíª **ToCode** 

- Install [Git-it (Desktop App)](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron/releases) : Git-it is a desktop (Mac, Windows and Linux) app that teaches you how to use Git and GitHub on the command line. It contains a set of challenges for learning Git and GitHub‚Äîby using real Git and GitHub. You'll be learning Git command lines and GitHub which means when you finish all of the challenges you'll have real repositories on your GitHub account.

- What to submit ?

Upon finishing the challenges : 


   - Access Microsoft Teams lecture team [3_SOC2022](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3aMEiRChRURbidsGLbg22vLjghxS2YhTGU7J9ovSHHpYE1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=7d6b776d-e6f8-4925-a125-0651c6cffb28&tenantId=dbd6664d-4eb9-46eb-99d8-5c43ba153c61) : This team is only for lecture material updates.
  
   - Join the `3_SOC2022` team with your official Microsoft email address so that you be part of the lecture teams : you can either use this code `srprux6` or send me an invite. You must use an official address (ending with `enicarthage.rnu.tn`); otherwise you will only be a guest to the lecture and you won't be able to submit your assignments later.

   - Edit the shared excel workbook [3ING service oriented computing groups 2022](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/file/64B0971B-04DC-418D-BCE8-E8799FDDB5E2?tenantId=dbd6664d-4eb9-46eb-99d8-5c43ba153c61&fileType=xlsx&objectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmohetn.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2F3_SOC2022950%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2F3ING%20service%20oriented%20computing%20groups_21-22.xlsx&baseUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmohetn.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2F3_SOC2022950&serviceName=teams&threadId=19:MEiRChRURbidsGLbg22vLjghxS2YhTGU7J9ovSHHpYE1@thread.tacv2&groupId=7d6b776d-e6f8-4925-a125-0651c6cffb28) and add your official email address and your github repository link once your have done the challenge and finished it.

## Preferred text editor:
  
It is highly recommended to use :

* üîó[Visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview) as it supports multiple extensions we will be using throughout this course.

* üîó[Atom](https://atom.io/) can also be used as it comes with basic Git and GitHub integration built in.
